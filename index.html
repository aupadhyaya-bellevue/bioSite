                        For the bioSite, initially I was little confused about who’s bio should I create and finally
                        chose to
                        do the same for my wife, Anupama. She is housewife and loves to cook various types of foods.
                        Being with her for a very long time, I really didn’t have to do any research about her hobbies,
                        and I know already how good cook she is and, it’s her kind of passion to do so.

                    <p>
                        When we came
                        to US about a decade back, she was doing cooking as a hobby and later she also started short of
                        her own business by serving Indian food to outside people where she has been quite successful.
                        She aspire to create her own youtube channel where she can post her own recipes along with
                        some easy ones that may help others to cook delicious food by their own. She also manages her
                        social media pages on Facebook and Instagram where she very often posts her recipes as well
                        as her experience and journey with cooking.

                    <p>
                        She wants to open her own Indian cuisine
                        restaurant on some day and trying very hard to achieve that goal. She has been cooking for a
                        very long time and her expertise is in Indian cuisine Indian dishes. Honestly to me she is super
                        woman who not only manages the entire house as well as kids but also now runs her own
                        business without even getting tired. I wish her very best of luck with her goal of opening her
                        own restaurant!!
