                        <strong>Cooking</strong><br>
                        Anupama has been cooking for a very long time and now it has become her most favorite hobby. She
                        loves to cook for friends and family. Her specialties are mostly in Indian cuisine but also
                        loves explore new recipes and experiment with some already known ones. She also recently started
                        this as her profession and now run her own business of home cooked food. She wants to take this
                        to the next level and open her own restaurant.
